# popgeninfer 0.0.0.9000 (2023-05-08)

- Added function `af_test`, which implements a clean and well-tested version of the allele frequency test first implemented by Tiffany Tu for the NS GWAS project.  This tests if the data from two datasets have the same allele frequency (null hypothesis) or not (alternative hypothesis).  Supports combining data from different ancestries into a single p-value.
